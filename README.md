# Portfolio

## What is it?
This is the repository where you can scan through the code from my most important projects. It also has both an html and a css file to present this in a webpage.

## How did I do it?
- Regarding this README, it is more or less a copy-paste from the Ambrosini Ballet readme :)
- To move my project files from my private repositories, I downloaded them and then uploaded them to my newly created folders within this repository.  
- For Ambrosini Ballet, you can look at the readme within that folder: [ambrosiniballet/README.md](https://github.com/gabriel-1607/Portfolio/blob/9bb8968589eb40a39a20eb40b14aa5d401ae3958/ambrosiniballet/README.md)  
- Regarding Speller, it was the week 5 exercise from the [CS50x course](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)
- As for the portfolio webpage, I got the basic html structure and css from [AI](https://zzzcode.ai/html/code-generator), then I improved it to meet my expectations.

## Why this way?
I follow the path of least resistance and, accordingly, I found that showcasing code within Github in separate files is so much more simple than trying to highlight it within a website in html pages.
